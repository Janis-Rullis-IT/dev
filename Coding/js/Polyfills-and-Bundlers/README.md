##  Is it NECESSARY nowadays to use a POLYFILL to support ES5+? A: NO NEED FOR POLYFILLS

> Since majority of browsers support these since 20105-2017 ?

By AndTemp:

"No... not at all.
Only if you work for government or really big companies that slowly update their software.
Every modern browser supports the good new js stuff.
if in doubt for certain language features you can go to caniuse.com and look it up if the browser you're trying to support, supports it."

If You're supporting and old browser then You're supporting the client to keep an unsafe browser. You should force him to change it.

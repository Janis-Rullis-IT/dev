## Benefits of Java Inner Class

If a class is useful to only one class, it makes sense to keep it nested and together. It helps in the packaging of the classes.
Java inner classes implements encapsulation. Note that inner classes can access outer class private members and at the same time we can hide inner class from outer world.
Keeping the small class within top-level classes places the code closer to where it is used and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

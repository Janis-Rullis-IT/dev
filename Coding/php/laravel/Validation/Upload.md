# Upload

### `Laravel question do we need $request->hasFile('file') if $request->validate is used?`

No, if you are using $request->validate() to validate the incoming HTTP request data in Laravel, you don't need to use $request->hasFile('file') to check if a file was uploaded.

When you use $request->validate() method to validate file uploads, it automatically checks if the file exists, is of the correct type, and meets any other validation rules you've specified. If the file fails any of the validation rules, Laravel will return an error response indicating which validation rule(s) the file failed to meet.

For example, the following code snippet shows how you can validate an incoming file upload using $request->validate() method in Laravel:

```php
$request->validate([
    'file' => 'required|file|max:2048',
]);
```
In this example, we are checking if the incoming request contains a file named "file", which is required, must be a valid file (i.e., not a directory), and has a maximum size of 2048 kilobytes. If the file fails any of these validation rules, Laravel will automatically return an error response with the corresponding error message.

So, to summarize, if you are using $request->validate() to validate file uploads in Laravel, you don't need to use $request->hasFile('file') to check if a file was uploaded since Laravel's validation system will automatically handle file existence checks and other validations for you.

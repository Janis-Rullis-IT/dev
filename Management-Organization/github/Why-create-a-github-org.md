# Why create a github organization?

* [2010 Introducing Organizations](https://blog.github.com/2010-06-29-introducing-organizations/).
* [Collaborating with groups in organizations](https://help.github.com/articles/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/).
* [Differences between user and organization accounts](https://help.github.com/articles/differences-between-user-and-organization-accounts/).

Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. 

## Use

The common use is for companies, where the code is shared and there isn't a single person, who owns the whole project. They have their repos and teams, created from github accounts.

The less common use, is for organizing your repos in groups, just like Surma does it with [Surma's Dump](https://github.com/surma-dump/) and [Surma-Slides](https://github.com/surma-slides).
This approach is not forbidden, because the rules does not require You to be a company or to have more than 1 account in the company.

# [GH-Wiki-vs-Code-Wiki](https://github.community/t/github-wiki-pages-vs-markdown-html-in-main-repository/458/2)

Wiki pages can be **EDITED much more FREELY** than files in the main repository.

They **DON'T require a PULL REQUEST or create a COMMIT in the main repository**

By default **anyone who is a COLLABORATOR CAN EDIT** the wiki and the ability to edit the wiki can be made completely open separate from the main repository

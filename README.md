## [Validation patterns](https://github.com/janis-rullis/lm1-symfony5-vue2-api/issues/23#issuecomment-711147395)

### Conclusion

After reading these practices I understood that **I still PREFER VALIDATION placed IN A METHOD that always sets the value and NOT in the CONSTRUCT**.  
This is because when putting VALIDATION IN CONSTRUCT **the method can be called LATER and thus validation rules BYPASSED and INVALID VALUES SET**.

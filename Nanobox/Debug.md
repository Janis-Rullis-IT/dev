## [Dry-run](https://docs.nanobox.io/workflow/dry-run/)

Once you think you're ready to deploy to live servers, Nanobox let's you "dry-run" a deploy with the deploy dry-run command. This will spin up a virtualized environment on your local machine and deploy to it just as it would to live servers. If a dry-run works locally, a deploy to production servers will work.

# JS Fiddle

## Common snags

### Document ready events does not execute

Click in the Javascript area, at the top select and choose Load type - No wrap in <body>. Default is onLoad which is after the ready so it is not executed.

### Public fiddle does not have the latest changes

Go to the latest fiddle and click 'Set as base'.

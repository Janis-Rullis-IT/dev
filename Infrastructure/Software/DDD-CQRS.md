## What DDD solves

IMO it helps a little in the biggest struggle of development -
NAMING THINGS.

It's no rocket science just an 
increased focus on semantically naming things in the project in agreed manner. 

Otherwise You end up with Apples being called TreeFruitProperty and elsewhere it will be Attribute.
Helps to avoid the confusion of the data flow - is the tree the main guy or the apple?
Should you put it in apple->pick() or tree->pickApples().

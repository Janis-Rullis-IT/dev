# [Search in github](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/)

By default github searches in file content and not in file structure, which means you 
won't find a file if the kewyord, you are searching, is not in the content.

## Tip

Include keywords in the content.

## [Finding files](https://help.github.com/articles/finding-files-on-github/)
* [Find `dummy-data.md` by `filename:dummy-data.md`](https://github.com/janis-rullis/github/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=filename%3Adummy-data.md&type=).

### Note

* Github ignores directories.
* Full filename must be included in the search otherwise it won't find.
